Questions:

When does asynchronous programming / behavior happen?
What is the purpose of resolving / rejecting
What is the difference between using promises and the async / await syntax
What is the NPM and why do we use it?

Why am I writing a question that has nothing to do with this?  Because I am learning about git pull!!
